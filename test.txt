This file gives annotation for each of the 3,432 CNVs that passed QC in the
WTCCCplus association study. For each CNV the best tagging SNP is defined as
the SNP with the highest R-squared value, that lies within a region from 1Mb
before the start co-ordinate of the CNV to 1Mb after the end co-ordinate of the
CNV. Note that some CNVs will not have tags as the non-missing calls for the
UKBS samples were all identical.


To create this list we have essentially done three separate analyses:

1. We used imputed SNP calls (created with CHIAMO and IMPUTE version 1, with
release 22 of HapMap CEPH) from WTCCC1 Affy 500k data for the UKBS samples that
were in common with samples from the WTCCC+ CNV study, and that passed standard
QC filters. Best HapMap tags were created from genotype correlations by finding
the highest R-squared value of a SNP within 1Mb of the CNV.

2. We used SNP calls (created with CHIAMO) from WTCCC2 Affy 6.0 data for the
UKBS samples that were in common with samples from the WTCCC+ CNV study, and
passed standard QC filters. We calculated genotype correlations between these
and our CNVs. Best Affy 6.0 tags were created from these correlations by finding
the highest R-squared value of a SNP within 1Mb of the CNV. Best Affy 500k tags
were created from these correlations by finding the highest R-squared of the
subset of these Affy 6.0 SNPs that are also on the Affy 500k array.

3. We used SNP calls (created with Illuminus) from WTCCC2 Illumina 1.2M data for
 the UKBS samples that were in common with samples from the WTCCC+ CNV study,
and passed standard QC filters. We calculated genotype correlations between
these and our CNVs. Best Illumina tags were created from these correlations by
finding the highest R-squared value of a SNP within 1Mb of the CNV. Best
Illumina 660 tags were created from these correlations by finding the highest
R-squared of the subset of these Illumina SNPs that are also on the Illumina
660 array.
